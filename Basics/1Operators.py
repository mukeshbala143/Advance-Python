# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

print(10 + 5)
# Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or two variables:

# Example
# sum1 = 100 + 50      # 150 (100 + 50)
# sum2 = sum1 + 250    # 400 (150 + 250)
# sum3 = sum2 + sum2   # 800 (400 + 400)


# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# +	Addition	x + y	
# -	Subtraction	x - y	
# *	Multiplication	x * y	
# /	Division	x / y	
# %	Modulus	x % y	
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y	
# //	Floor division	x // y	


# Examples
# Here is an example using different arithmetic operators:

x = 15
y = 4

print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)
print(x ** y)
print(x // y)
# Division in Python
# Python has two division operators:

# / - Division (returns a float)
# // - Floor division (returns an integer)
# Example
# Division always returns a float:

x = 12
y = 5

print(x / y)
# Example
# Floor division always returns an integer.

# It rounds DOWN to the nearest integer:

x = 12
y = 5

print(x // y)

# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator	
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
# :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
# print(x)	


# The Walrus Operator
# Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the "walrus operator". It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression:

# The count variable is assigned in the if statement, and given the value 5:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if (count := len(numbers)) > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")


# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	

# Examples
# Comparison operators return True or False based on the comparison:

x = 5
y = 3

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
# Chaining Comparison Operators
# Python allows you to chain comparison operators:

# Example
x = 5

print(1 < x < 10)

print(1 < x and x < 10)

# Python Logical Operators
# Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)	
# Examples
# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Test if a number is greater than 0 and less than 10:

x = 5

print(x > 0 and x < 10)
# Example
# Test if a number is less than 5 or greater than 10:

x = 5

print(x < 5 or x > 10)
# Example
# Reverse the result with not:

x = 5

print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))

# Python Identity Operators
# Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y	
# Examples
# The is operator returns True if both variables point to the same object:

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z)
print(x is y)
print(x == y)
# Example
# The is not operator returns True if both variables do not point to the same object:

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]

print(x is not y)


# Difference Between is and ==
# is - Checks if both variables point to the same object in memory
# == - Checks if the values of both variables are equal
# Example
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x == y)
print(x is y)

# Python Membership Operators
# Membership Operators
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y	
# Examples
# Check if "banana" is present in a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("banana" in fruits)
# Example
# Check if "pineapple" is NOT present in a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("pineapple" not in fruits)


# Membership in Strings
# The membership operators also work with strings:

# Example
text = "Hello World"

print("H" in text)
print("hello" in text)
print("z" not in text)

# Python Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

# Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
# ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
# ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2	


# Examples
# The & operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if both are 1, otherwise it is set to 0:

print(6 & 3)
# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011

# Then the & operator compares the bits and returns 0010, which is 2 in decimal.

# Example
# The | operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if one or both is 1, otherwise it is set to 0:

print(6 | 3)
# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011

# Then the | operator compares the bits and returns 0111, which is 7 in decimal.

# Example
# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:

print(6 ^ 3)
# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011

# Then the ^ operator compares the bits and returns 0101, which is 5 in decimal.

# Python Operator Precedence
# Operator Precedence
# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))
# Example
# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)
# Precedence Order
# The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

# Operator	Description	Try it
# ()	Parentheses	
# **	Exponentiation	
# +x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
# *  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
# +  -	Addition and subtraction	
# <<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
# &	Bitwise AND	
# ^	Bitwise XOR	
# |	Bitwise OR	
# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
# not	Logical NOT	
# and	AND	
# or	OR	

# Left-to-Right Evaluation
# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

# Example
# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
