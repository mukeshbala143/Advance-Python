# What is Python?
# Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

# Why Python?
# Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
# Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
# Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
# Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
# Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

print("Hello !! Welcome to python programming..")

# To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the sys module:
