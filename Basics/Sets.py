# Python Sets
# myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# Set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

# Sets are written with curly brackets.

# Create a Set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# print(thisset)
# Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

# Set Items
# Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

# Unordered
# Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

# Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

# Unchangeable
# Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.


# Duplicates Not Allowed
# Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

# Example
# Duplicate values will be ignored:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

# print(thisset)
# Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:

# Example
# True and 1 is considered the same value:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2}

# print(thisset)
# Note: The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:

# Example
# False and 0 is considered the same value:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", False, True, 0}

# print(thisset)

# Get the Length of a Set
# To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.

# Example
# Get the number of items in a set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# print(len(thisset))
# Set Items - Data Types
# Set items can be of any data type:

# Example
# String, int and boolean data types:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
# set3 = {True, False, False}
# A set can contain different data types:

# Example
# A set with strings, integers and boolean values:

# set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
# type()
# From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':

# <class 'set'>
# Example
# What is the data type of a set?

# myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# print(type(myset))
# The set() Constructor
# It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.

# Example
# Using the set() constructor to make a set:

# thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
# print(thisset)
# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
# *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

# **As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
# Python - Access Set Items
# Access Items
# You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

# But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

# Loop through the set, and print the values:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# for x in thisset:
#   print(x)
# Example
# Check if "banana" is present in the set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# print("banana" in thisset)
# Example
# Check if "banana" is NOT present in the set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# print("banana" not in thisset)
# Change Items
# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

# Python - Add Set Items
# Add Items
# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

# To add one item to a set use the add() method.

# Add an item to a set, using the add() method:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# thisset.add("orange")

# print(thisset)
# Add Sets
# To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.

# Example
# Add elements from tropical into thisset:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

# thisset.update(tropical)

# print(thisset)
# Add Any Iterable
# The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).

# Example
# Add elements of a list to a set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]

# thisset.update(mylist)

# print(thisset)

# Python - Remove Set Items
# Remove Item
# To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.

# Remove "banana" by using the remove() method:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# thisset.remove("banana")

# print(thisset)
# Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.

# Example
# Remove "banana" by using the discard() method:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# thisset.discard("banana")

# print(thisset)
# Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.

# You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.

# The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.

# Example
# Remove a random item by using the pop() method:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# x = thisset.pop()

# print(x)

# print(thisset)
# Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed.

# Example
# The clear() method empties the set:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# thisset.clear()

# print(thisset)
# Example
# The del keyword will delete the set completely:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# del thisset

# print(thisset)
# Python - Loop Sets
# Loop Items
# You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:

# Loop through the set, and print the values:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# for x in thisset:
#   print(x)
# Python - Join Sets
# Join Sets
# There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

# The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.

# The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.

# The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).

# The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.

# Union
# The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.

# Join set1 and set2 into a new set:

# set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
# set2 = {1, 2, 3}

# set3 = set1.union(set2)
# print(set3)
# You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use | to join two sets:

# set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
# set2 = {1, 2, 3}

# set3 = set1 | set2
# print(set3)
# Join Multiple Sets
# All the joining methods and operators can be used to join multiple sets.

# When using a method, just add more sets in the parentheses, separated by commas:

# Example
# Join multiple sets with the union() method:

# set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
# set2 = {1, 2, 3}
# set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
# set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

# myset = set1.union(set2, set3, set4)
# print(myset)
# When using the | operator, separate the sets with more | operators:

# Example
# Use | to join two sets:

# set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
# set2 = {1, 2, 3}
# set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
# set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

# myset = set1 | set2 | set3 |set4
# print(myset)
# Join a Set and a Tuple
# The union() method allows you to join a set with other data types, like lists or tuples.

# The result will be a set.

# Example
# Join a set with a tuple:

# x = {"a", "b", "c"}
# y = (1, 2, 3)

# z = x.union(y)
# print(z)
# Note: The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.

# Update
# The update() method inserts all items from one set into another.

# The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.

# Example
# The update() method inserts the items in set2 into set1:

# set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
# set2 = {1, 2, 3}

# set1.update(set2)
# print(set1)
# Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.



# Intersection
# Keep ONLY the duplicates

# The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

# Example
# Join set1 and set2, but keep only the duplicates:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
# print(set3)
# You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use & to join two sets:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1 & set2
# print(set3)
# Note: The & operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the intersection() method.

# The intersection_update() method will also keep ONLY the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Keep the items that exist in both set1, and set2:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set1.intersection_update(set2)

# print(set1)
# The values True and 1 are considered the same value. The same goes for False and 0.

# Example
# Join sets that contains the values True, False, 1, and 0, and see what is considered as duplicates:

# set1 = {"apple", 1,  "banana", 0, "cherry"}
# set2 = {False, "google", 1, "apple", 2, True}

# set3 = set1.intersection(set2)

# print(set3)
# Difference
# The difference() method will return a new set that will contain only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set.

# Example
# Keep all items from set1 that are not in set2:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1.difference(set2)

# print(set3)
# You can use the - operator instead of the difference() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use - to join two sets:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1 - set2
# print(set3)
# Note: The - operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the difference() method.

# The difference_update() method will keep the items from the first set that are not in the other set, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Use the difference_update() method to keep only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set1.difference_update(set2)

# print(set1)
# Symmetric Differences
# The symmetric_difference() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.

# Example
# Keep the items that are not present in both sets:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

# print(set3)
# You can use the ^ operator instead of the symmetric_difference() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use ^ to join two sets:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set3 = set1 ^ set2
# print(set3)
# Note: The ^ operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the symmetric_difference() method.

# The symmetric_difference_update() method will also keep all but the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Use the symmetric_difference_update() method to keep the items that are not present in both sets:

# set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

# set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)

# print(set1)

# Python frozenset
# Python frozenset
# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.

# Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.

# Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

# Creating a frozenset
# Use the frozenset() constructor to create a frozenset from any iterable.

# Create a frozenset and check its type:

# x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
# print(x)
# print(type(x))
# Frozenset Methods
# Being immutable means you cannot add or remove elements. However, frozensets support all non-mutating operations of sets.
