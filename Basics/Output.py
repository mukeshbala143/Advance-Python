# Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:

print("Hi")
print('Hi')

# Print Without a New Line
# By default, the print() function ends with a new line.
# If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter:

print("Hi", end =" ")
print("Kai")

# Print Numbers
# You can also use the print() function to display numbers:
# However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

print(24)
print(11+11+2)

print("KaiX",24,"XBloodyhell")
